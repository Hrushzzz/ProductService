*** Calling 3rd Party APIs ***

1. Write the mechanism to call - getAllProduct and getProductById APIs on fakeStore.
2. Create our own APIs, to get all products and getProductById which will
   internally call fakeStore and show the data.

CLIENT <-> ProductService <-> FakeStoreAPI

controller -> contains the APIs
service -> contains the business logic
repository -> talks to DB, does CRUD
model -> contains schema
client -> classes that will talk to other services

ProductService -> FakeStore Service
FakeStoreClient -> contains the code to communicate with FakeStore

Spring -->
RestTemplate -> becoming deprecated
WebClient -> latest

Code Flow :::
 ProductController --> ProductService --> FakeStoreClient ... And then back in the same way.
